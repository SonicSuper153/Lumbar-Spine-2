This project is a machine learning-based application for detecting lumbar spine conditions. The application analyzes medical report image and provides insights to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing spinal issues.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload their report image for analysis.
- **Condition Detection**: The application utilizes trained models to detect various lumbar spine conditions, including:
  - Lumbar Spondylosis (LSD)
  - Osteophyte Formation (OSF)
  - Spinal Deformities (Spider)
  - Spinal Stenosis (TSEG)
- **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive interface for seamless interaction with the application.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling)
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.
