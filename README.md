- **Image Upload**: Users can upload their report image for analysis.
- **Condition Detection**: The application utilizes trained models to detect various lumbar spine conditions, including:
  - Lumbar Spondylosis (LSD)
  - Osteophyte Formation (OSF)
  - Spinal Deformities (Spider)
  - Spinal Stenosis (TSEG)
- **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive interface for seamless interaction with the application.

## Technologies Used
